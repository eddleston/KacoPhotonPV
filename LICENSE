Process to take serial data from Kaco inverter and upload
to pvoutput.org

With thanks to Ian Hutt, this c++ version adapted from the python version:
https://github.com/cvpeck/KacoPV/blob/master/kaco2pvo/kaco2pvo.py

To be run on Particle Photon, connected to inverter via serial adapter, e.g.:
https://amzn.to/2QMKJFo

To test, un-comment the LOCAL_TESTING=“Test”

Data gets delivered to PVOutput.org by setting up a webhook in Particle Cloud
and using pass through parameters (  e.g. v1: {{{v1}}}  )
